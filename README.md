# 💯 Weighted Average System for Grades
A weighted average system application as a [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com) Project.

## 💻 About this project
This application is a Java-built system to be used to register evaluation grades and calculate the weighted average.

The user must run the application from the terminal, as well use it to input the data que app will ask for.
The application will first ask how many evaluations the user wants to register (like a set). Then, for each of the evaluations, will be asked evaluation name, evaluation weight and evaluation grade obtained.
The sum of evaluation weights of a set to be registered must be 100.
With all evaluations registered, the application will calculate the final grade and inform it with a approval message if the final grade is greater than 85.0%.
